# howiusescss

How I currently use SCSS with only a reliance on [scssphp](https://github.com/leafo/scssphp).

Usage: /scsser/site.css === compilation of /assets/site.scss

This does use temporary files so make sure they are being cleaned!

N.B. you may hate all of this but it is more of a reference for myself than anything.
